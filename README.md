### What I learned

1. I improved my understanding of how to dynamically create and modify HTML elements using JavaScript
2. I learned how to add and remove event listeners effectively.
3. Filtering job listings using filter() and every() deepened my knowledge of array methods



### Continued development

I want to continue refining my layout skills, especially in making responsive designs more fluid.

Understanding how to handle and manipulate JSON data efficiently is something I plan to work on more.

Instead of adding individual event listeners to each filter, I plan to use event delegation for better performance.
